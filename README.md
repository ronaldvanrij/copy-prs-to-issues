## `poll-github-repo` action

This action can be useful if your repo depends on specific files in other repo and you want to be notified
every time these files are changed.

GitHub actions can be configured to run periodicaly using `on: schedule` setup:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Run every day
    - cron: '0 1 * * *'
```

Naming:

+ `current repo` - your repository that runs this action
+ `repo-to-sync` - repository that you want to track
+ `target file` - file in `repo-to-sync` that you want to track

The action:

1. retrieves `last sync date` from the `current repo` (filepath is taken from your action configuration). It's just a timestamp stored in ISO format.
2. retrieves all commits from the `repo-to-sync` that modify `target file` and are older than `last sync date` from the previous step.
3. for each commit it creates an issue in the `current repo` according to configured templates.
4. finally, it creates a commit that modifies `last sync date` in the `current repo`

Usage:

```yaml
  - uses: poll-github-repo/action@v1
    with:
        # Repository you want to track
        # Must have a format "owner/repo" (like "facebook/react")
        repo-to-sync: owner/repo

        # Path to a local file that stores timestamps of the last check in ISO format.
        # This is required to check only a small subset of changes on every run.
        # NOTE: this file MUST exist before the action runs
        # 2022-03-18T00:33:40Z is an example of what it could contain
        cache-path: .sync/CHANGELOG.md.last-sync

        # Label that is added to every created issue
        tracking-issue-label: upstream-changelog-md

        # Template for tracking issue title (see available placeholders below)
        tracking-issue-title: "Update on {{ path }}: {{ sha-short }}"

        # Template for tracking issue body (see available placeholders below)
        tracking-issue-body: |
            New commit in owner/repo:

            **{{ message }}** [link]({{ url }})
            token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            yes-create-issues: true

        # GitHub token
        #
        # You can use ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} to create issues/commits
        # using `github-actions` account.
        #
        # Of course, you can generate and pass token
        # of your own GitHub bot if you want to
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

        # Special boolean flag that simplifies initial setup
        #
        # When set to `false` the action doesn't do any issues/commit creation,
        # but it still prints what would be created
        #
        # Configure everything, make sure it does what expected and set it to `true`
        yes-create-issues: false
```

Available placeholders:

+ `{{ path }}` - path of the file that is tracked, useful if you track multiple files
+ `{{ sha-short }}` - short (7 chars) SHA of the observed commit
+ `{{ sha-full }}` - full SHA of the observer commit
+ `{{ message }}` - message of the observed commit
+ `{{ commit-date }}` - creation date of the observer commit
+ `{{ url }}` - GitHub URL that points to observer commit

Step outputs:

* `newCommitsInSyncRepo`: A boolean indicating wheter there where any new commits to the synced repo or not
* `newCommits`: If `newCommitsInSyncRepo` is true, this contains a stringified JSON array containing an object for each commit with its path,
  url, sha, message and date:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "data.txt",
    "url": "https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-source-repo/commit/a52684431a3fda35c2ac4cde291071a3430f2268",
    "sha": "a52684431a3fda35c2ac4cde291071a3430f2268",
    "message": "update data.txt (three)",
    "date": "2022-03-14T16:23:55Z"
  }
]
```

* `createdIssues`:  If `yes-create-issues` is true, this contains a stringified JSON array containing an object with the issue number
  and its url for each created issue:

```json
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "url": "https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-observer-repo/issues/1"
  }
]
```

### Example

`poll-github-repo` action has two dummy repositories:

+ [`dummy-source-repo`](https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-source-repo)
+ [`dummy-observer-repo`](https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-observer-repo)

`dummy-source-repo` has `data.txt` file with 3 commits that `dummy-observer-repo` monitors.
Observer repo stores last sync date in [`.last-sync` file](https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-observer-repo/blob/main/.last-sync)

1. [GitHub action on observer repo](https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-observer-repo/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml) is configured to create an issue on every commit that modifies `data.txt`
2. Here's the [list of created issues](https://github.com/poll-github-repo/dummy-observer-repo/issues)
3. And here's the output of the action (it will be removed eventually)
